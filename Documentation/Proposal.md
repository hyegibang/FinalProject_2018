# Proposal
## Main Idea
The main idea of the project is to utilize android phone as a wireless, controllable remote control for a computer. The minimum viable project is to design an android app that would allow users to navigate cursor on computer and perform a right and left click. Our stretch goal is to apply gesture on screen that would provide a shortcut in certain apps.
## Learning Goal
Hyegi
* Learn about app development
* Learn about UI in Python

Jon
* Learn about making python scripts that interact with other programs
* Learn about bluetooth connections and sending info wirelessly
* Learn about mobile development


## Implementation Plan
* Pybluez
* Pygame
## Project Schedule
Within the first two weeks, we wish to have a working MVP. Since we are merging our Software Design project with our Project and Market project, we wish to have a feasible MVP to present to people as soon as possible. By the fourth week, we hope to have a perfect MVP. However, based on the feedbacks we receive from both classes, we would refine our project. By week six, we hope to have our stretch goal accomplished.  
## Collaboration plan
We will work on separate parts of the project so that we would not face any merge conflicts but have a regular meeting. "Grab and Go"

## Biggest Risks
Developing an app and getting our user interface to work in a nice user-friendly and intuitive manner.
