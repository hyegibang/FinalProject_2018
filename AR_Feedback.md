# Architectural Review feedback
## Hyegi Bang and Jonathan Zerez

## Feedback and decisions
  Our biggest concern with the project was whether the project will be used with built. We wanted to build something sustainable. From the feedback, in the scale of 5, 1 being not useful and 5 being useful, we got 3.9 as an average. Another question we brought up was the scope level of the project and aftermath of our MVP.We obseved in general, there was a small amount of support and excitement for people in general, especally those who use CAD extensively. From that we learned that to really make a valiable product, we need to take advantage of the things that phones can do that mice can't: touch screen and accelorometer. 
  
## Review process reflection  
  Architectural Review was successful. We got out more than we expected to. The questions were answered and feedback established a new guide for our project. We provide enough context for the audience so that feedbacks could be given. One valueable outcome we received was that people were more appealed for the app to be solidworks specific, 3D mouse for solidworks, than the using mouse as a phone. Therefore, we will do research into 3D mice and how they work as well as we think about vibaration and sound feedback.
