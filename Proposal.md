# Proposal
## Main Idea
The main idea of the project is to use android phone as a wireless, controllable remote control for a computer. The minimum viable project is to design an android app that would allow users to navigate cursor on computer and perform a right and left click. Our stretch goal is to apply gesture on screen that would provide a shortcut in certain apps. 
## Learning Goal 
Hyegi 
* Learn about app development 
* Learn about UI in Python 

Jon 


## Implementation Plan 
* Pybluez
* Pygame 
## Project Schedule 
Within the first two weeks, we wish to have a working MVP. Since we are collaborating the project with our Project and Market project, we wish to have a feasible MVP to present to people. We wish to have a perfect MVP by week four. However, based on the feedbacks we receive from both classes, we would refine our MVP throughout. By week six, we hope to have our stretch goal accomplished.  
## Collaboration plan 
We wil work on seperate parts of the project so that we would not face any merge conflicts. 

## Biggest Risks 
Developing an app and getting our user interface to work in a nice user-friendly and intuitive manner.
