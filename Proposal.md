# Proposal
## Main Idea
The main idea of the project is to use android phone as a wireless, controllable remote control for a computer. The minimum viable project is to design an android app that would allow users to navigate cursor on computer and perform a right and left click. Our stretch goal is to apply gesture on screen that would provide a shortcut in certain apps.
