# Architectural Review feedback 2
## Hyegi Bang and Jonathan Zerez

## Feedback and decisions
We didn't get a lot of super helpful feedback, mainly due to the nature of our project. That being said, we did get some good suggestions to help in the distribution of the project, which was really helpful, as well as some pretty interesting high level design suggestions. Because we would like for this project to be easily usable for anyone who wants to use it, we will definitely look into some of the suggestions for packaging our project. Namely, we will look into how to convert our project into a .exe in order avoid requiring the user to install a bunch of dependencies.

In terms of the high level design suggestions, notably, we got the feedback to turn our project into a project team live demonstration tool. We probably will not have the time (or the patience at this point) to carry them out to completion. Our project as it is now is in a pretty good place, and to polish it further or to execute a significant design change at this point would just not be feasible.

## Review process reflection  
The Architectural Review was pretty successful. We did not get as much out of it as we had originally hoped, and that was partially due to the scope of our project. The people who were reviewing our project were just unfamiliar with the techniques we were using to do the project, so it was hard for them to provide more useful lower level feedback. We were able to finished the planned material pretty quickly, which opened the floor to more open questions.

In terms of the logistics of the review, we definitely could have prepared a bit more. We probably could have made a power point presentation to get our info across rather than just showing off the readme. In addition, we could have more properly scoped the questions for the audience in order to get more helpful feedback.
